# Planet Crafter — Save file format

> ❗Docs written by AI from save file analysis (proofread, but still can include mistakes)

---
**JSON Schemas** : each section has a validation schema in [`packages/shared-save-processing/schemas/`](../packages/shared-save-processing/schemas/), and validation applies every one of the ten, entry by entry. The world objects section is no exception, although it reaches validation as a generator: its entries meet their schema one at a time as the section is walked, so a save of any size only ever holds one world object in memory.
The root schema [`save-file.schema.json`](../packages/shared-save-processing/schemas/save-file.schema.json) validates a fully parsed save (array of 11 sections, indexes 0 to 10).

## General structure

A save file is a raw text string split into **11 sections** (indexes 0 to 10) separated by `@`. Each section is a list of JSON objects
separated by `|\n`.
The file ends with `@`.

```
<section 0>@<section 1>@...@<section 10>@
```

> ⚠️ **Backward compatibility:** an earlier version of the save format also had a Terrain Layers section (index 9,
> shifting World Events to index 10), which a game update removed. Legacy saves in that older format are only
> supported at the user-input boundary (loading a save file): they are automatically adapted to the current
> 11-section format described below, discarding the Terrain Layers data, and a warning is reported to the user.
> Validation detects the adaptation and is the single source of that warning, on every outcome and in every flow
> (displaying a save, merging saves, `bun validate`, `bun merge`). The warning travels as the code defined in
> `packages/shared-save-processing/normalizeRawSections.js` and is turned into the sentence shown to the user by
> `packages/core-mapping/src/presentation/formatSaveWarning.ts`.

```

```

A section is read line by line, and a line that is not valid JSON is **reported and located**, never ignored:
`packages/shared-save-processing/parseSaveSections.js` is the single reader of this format and reports
`{detail, section, entryIndex}` for every line it could not read, keeping the readable entries around it.
Validation turns those reports into located errors (`bun validate` exits 1 and names the section and the entry
position), and merging refuses to write a save whose input carries one. Blank sections stay silent: each section is
trimmed first, which covers the reserved part the terminating `@` produces and the line break the game writes before
the first entry of a section.

### #3 — World Objects

**Cardinality:** N entries (buildings, resources, plants…). Domain key: `id`.

All properties except `id` and `gId` are optional depending on object type. `id` and `gId` are the only two
carried by every entry of the ten reference saves (190338 world objects); the next most frequent, `pos` and
`planet`, are on 14.31% of them.

| Property   | Type     | Description                                                                                 |
|------------|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `id`       | `int`    | Unique object ID                                                                            |

| `rot`      | `string` | Quaternion rotation `"x,y,z,w"`                                                             |
| `planet`   | `int`    | Planet numeric ID, of either sign (e.g. `-1140328421` for Prime, `110910045` for Toxicity)  |
| `count`    | `string` | Amount or cumulative state (e.g. ores in a vein `"0,125"`)                                  |
| `grwth`    | `int`    | Growth progression (plants)                                                                 |
| `pnls`     | `string` | Produced power (solar panels, generators)                                                   |

| `trtInd`   | `int`    | Associated terraformation stage index                                                       |
| `liId`     | `int`    | Linked list id (logistics / drones)                                                         |
| `liPlanet` | `int`    | Planet numeric ID of the linked inventory `liId`, not the planet the object stands on       |
| `text`     | `string` | Displayed text (signs, panels)                                                              |
| `liGrps`   | `string` | Comma separated list of associated object types (item generation, blueprint)                |
| `linkedWo` | `int`    | → `WorldObject.id` — associated world object (e.g. toxic water generator ↔ associated lake) |
| `siIds`    | `string` | Comma separated list of generated items (e.g. beans generated by a farm)                    |
| `woIds`    | `string` | → `WorldObject.id` — comma separated ids of the world objects held (see `GR-ID-3`)          |
| `trtVal`   | `int`    | Terraformation contribution value — an object that holds one also names its `trtInd`        |
| `hunger`   | `float`  | Animal hunger, from `-100` to `100`                                                         |
| `set`      | `int`    | Equipment set identifier                                                                    |

**What the reference saves say about the rarest three:** `liPlanet` appears 21 times, every time on an
`InterplanetaryExchangePlatform1` and every time naming a planet other than the object's own — an exchange
platform points at an inventory sitting on another planet. `hunger` appears 345 times, on entries of `gId`
`DNASequence` only, between `-100` and `94.22`; the bounds the schema states are the symmetric scale the game
is assumed to work on (an animal yields a DNA sequence while its hunger is positive) rather than a documented
range, and the first legitimate save they reject lifts them. `woIds` is on no world object of the ten saves,
but the merge remaps it (`GR-ID-3`), so the schema declares it rather than reject a save the merge handles.

**Planet numeric IDs:** `planet` (here) as well as `WorldEvent.planet` (see below) reference a planet using a
numeric ID rather than the textual `planetId` used elsewhere (`TerraformationLevel.planetId`,
`Player.planetId`, `SaveConfiguration.planetId`). This numeric ID is **stable across saves** (not derived from
the save's world seed or content) — confirmed by cross-referencing several real save files:

| Numeric `planet` ID | Planet name (`planetId`) |
|--------------------:|--------------------------|
|       `-1140328421` | `Prime`                  |
|         `110910045` | `Toxicity`               |
|       `-1016990411` | `Selenea`                |
|        `-486276833` | `Humble`                 |
|       `-1291310150` | `Aqualis`                |

No known deterministic hash function (crc32, fnv1a, djb2, sdbm, Java-style `hashCode`, …) reproduces these IDs
from the planet name, so this table is currently maintained as a fixed lookup rather than computed.

## Appendix — Legacy format (before the Terrain Layers section was removed)

Saves created before a game update had **12 sections** (indexes 0 to 11): sections 0 to 8 were identical to the
current format, but section 9 was **Terrain Layers**, World Events was at index 10, and the reserved empty section
was at index 11.

| Property          | Type     | Description                                   |
|-------------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `layerId`         | `string` | Id of the layer (e.g. `"PC-Toxicity-Layer2"`) |
| `planet`          | `int`    | Planet numeric ID                             |
| `colorBase`       | `string` | Base color as `"R-G-B-A"`                     |
| `colorCustom`     | `string` | Custom color as `"R-G-B-A"`                   |
| `colorBaseLerp`   | `int`    | Base color intensity (≥ 0)                    |
| `colorCustomLerp` | `int`    | Custom color intensity (≥ 0)                  |

This section no longer exists in the current save format. When a legacy save is loaded or merged, its Terrain Layers
data is discarded and the user is warned that their save was adapted from an old format.
